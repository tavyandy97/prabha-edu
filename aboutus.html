		The deteriorating conditions of primary and elementary education systems in the rural areas of our country are a well-accepted fact. Education has been characterized by a high pupil-teacher ratio, teacher absenteeism, poor teaching and learning atmosphere, poor school infrastructure, no camaraderie between the community and school, high drop-out rates, etc. A large number of studies conducted by different organizations in different parts of the country reflect this situation.  With little regulation and the demand for "quality of education", the private sector has stepped in rural areas.  However, they have lack of expertise in the education field and they do not have basic infrastructure and vision to provide the quality education which is at par with the urban area. World class facilities like swimming pool, playgrounds, coaches etc. also need attention in rural areas. The contention made by the rural mass is that if they are paying a fee, they will probably receive quality education. A number of schools have sprung up but then such schools are just not accountable and open and close each year.  They make the decision on market conditions in the area and profitability rather than 'education'. Their performance is marginally better than the government run schools but it is still far from providing quality education. Teachers at these schools are usually unemployed graduates (or even less) who themselves represent everything that is wrong with the education system. <br><br>
		Providing access and quality education are the two important aspects for any education administration. Quality education however remains the issue and is still out of reach of the majority of the rural mass. More importantly, in the absence of good quality efforts, communities are not even sure of what to demand in terms of quality. Yet their search continues. Therefore, to start with a mission, Prabha Education Trust has taken the initiatives to start the quality education in the rural area of Assam especially in the border area of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.  To start with, the Trust has selected its first project in Silapathar, District Dhemaji, which is a census town. It is well located at the border of Arunachal Pradesh, a strategic frontier of INDIA. It is inhabited by heterogeneous population of tribal, Ahom, Sutiyas, Bodo, Sonwal,  Kachari, Mising and other tribal groups of Arunachal Pradesh such as Galo and Adi along with non tribals such as Nepali, Hindi speaking, Punjabi, Bengali. Recently INDIAN ARMY Cantonment board is about to get established with near about 1000 household.  This strategic area lacks quality education and infrastructure which can sustain the changing demographic demands. <br><br>
		Prabha Education Trust (a national level trust) was formed on 15/02/2018 by 5 partners with similar vision to improve the quality of education in rural areas. Looking in to the education background of the trustee, it is very much evident that trust will excel in its vision and mission to improve the quality of the education of the rural area.
